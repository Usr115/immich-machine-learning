This is for building a compose file that allows Immich to use a GPU for machine learning.

Edit the compose file to match your configuration, including the type of GPU you are using, and your LLM's IP address and port.

Once you've modified it to fit your build, save the changes, and run the compose file through Docker compose.
If using Unraid, add the Docker Compose Plugin to your server to run a compose file.  It can be found in CA Apps.
